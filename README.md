# simply-weather

How about an app called "Just the Weather"? It's a weather app with a twist: it's overly simplified. When you open the app, it doesn't show any numbers or forecasts, just a single phrase that describes the weather for the day, such as "It's sunny, wear a hat" or "It's raining, grab an umbrella". The app could use minimalistic graphics and one-liners to convey the weather, making it both straightforward and a bit humorous. It's so simple that it might just work for those who want a quick, no-fuss update on the weather without the details.
